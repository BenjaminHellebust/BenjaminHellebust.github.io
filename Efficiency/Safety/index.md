How safe is nuclear energy in comparison to fossil fuels?


* Due to fossil fuels, "[m]ore than 100 million people in the United States live in communities where air pollution
exceeds health-based air quality standards" (U.S. Global Change Research Program, p. 513)


* New safety features are consistently being added to nuclear power plants, ensuring previous tragedies do not occur. (Moniz)


* As for nuclear waste, it is stored deep underground in specific locations as to not endanger the public in any way. (Horvath, S41-42)


* New reactors like Molten Salt Reactors are much, much safer.
