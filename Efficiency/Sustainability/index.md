What makes nuclear energy sustainable, if it uses a somewhat limited resource?


* The energy content of fissile material is incredibly high, so even though it's 'limited' we actually have enough fuel to power the world for a very long time.

* Traditional fossil fuels are not sustainable because they use resources that take millions of years to accumulate.

* New "breeder" reactors can create more nuclear fuel and even recycle nuclear waste. (Horvath, S43)

* 4th generation reactors build upon this current technology. Making reactors up to 50x more efficient (Horvath, S43-44)
