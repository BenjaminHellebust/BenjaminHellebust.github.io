How does the effects of nuclear energy's byproducts and fossil fuel's byproducts differ? 


* When burnt, fossil fuels produce harmful chemicals like nitrogen oxide and sulfer dioxide which cause acid rain!


* Fossil fuels in the energy sector account for 83% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. (U.S. Global Change Research Program, p.514)


* Due to advancements in 4th generation reactors, nuclear waste's lifetime can be reduced to a couple hundred years. (Horvath, S38)


* The only direct air emissions from nuclear power plants are water vapor. In fact, nuclear power plants have the lowest indirect carbon emissions among differing power sources. (Markandya, p. 982)

  ```
  1. Elaborate on how nitrogen oxide and sulfer dioxide accumulate and cause acid rain.
  2. Mention the nearest coal plant we have here in Kansas. Use this as an example to showcase how fossil fuel burning for energy rather than cars is more common than one might expect.
  3. Reference the nuclear power plant generation chart that was shown. Clarify that a couple hundred of years is actually very small time from a societal perspective.
