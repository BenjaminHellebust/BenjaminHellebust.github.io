So why should you care? Well, one reason is disease.


* "[W]orsened air pollution would increase the incidence of adverse respiratory and
cardiovascular health effects, including premature death" (U.S. Global Change Research Program, p. 513).


* "Many emission sources of greenhouse gases also emit air pollutants that harm human
health" (U.S. Global Change Research Program, p. 514).


* Fossil fuels cause the most direct and indirect deaths per terawatt an hour among power sources. (Markandya, p. 981)

  ```
  1. Reference previous statistic of how more than 100 million Americans have air quality worse than the health standard and how this sheds light on the effects.
  2. Reference previous statistic that most of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by fossil fuels burned for energy production.
  3. Note on how this statistic should be common sense given the sheer scale.
