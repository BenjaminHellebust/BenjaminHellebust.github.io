Another reason is the food chain.



* Fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide, a common greenhouse gas warms the atmosphere and causes increased rainfall, when burned.


* This causes "[s]ustainable crop production [to be] threatened by excessive runoff, leaching, and flooding, which results in soil erosion, degraded water quality in lakes and streams, and damage to rural community infrastructure" (U.S. Global Change Research Program, pp. 392)


* Furthermore, carbon dioxide can mix with ocean water causing acidification.


* This means "[m]arine ecosystems and the coastal communities that depend on them are at risk of significant
impacts from extreme events with combinations of very high temperatures, very low oxygen
levels, or very acidified conditions." (U.S. Global Change Research Program, p. 354)

  ```
  1. Read the description under the image.
  2. Explain the greenhouse gas effect. Compare it to a blanket.
  3. Connect this idea with getting food. A lot of crops are produced in the U.S. and other areas that are impacted.
  4. Briefly explain the proccess in which ocean accidification happens.
  5. Explain how this can impact getting fish. Explain how coral reefs help shelter fish.
