But what IS a nuclear reactor?


* A nuclear reactor is a power plant that uses fissile material to generate electricity.


* Nuclear reactors convert heat into electric energy, usually through a turbine.


* The most common way the turbine is spun is by evaporating water.


* The only air-borne byproduct is therefore water, with the only other byproducts being various forms of radioactive waste that decay over time and are safely stored until then.
