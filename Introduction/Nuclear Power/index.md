But what about other popular forms of green energy like wind and solar?


* Energies like wind and solar are time, weather, and location reliant, making them variable in output and require significant land.


* Due to their variable nature, they require batteries to store excess energy in order to supply power during times of low production.


* Batteries often require rare or expensive metals to produce and require replacements every so often.


* Nuclear power makes up 17% of global power generation and it's possible to further scale it up! (Markandya, p. 988)

  ```
  1. Read the description under the image.
  2. Wind requires high, open space. Solar requires clear open skies.
  3. Further clarify point 2 via example (i.e. "imagine..")
  4. Lithium-Ion batteries are the most common type of battery currently used in power grid storage - Lithium is a rare and progressively depleting rare earth.
