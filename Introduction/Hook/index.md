Where's the drive for nuclear energy?


* In an editorial for Science titled "A fresh look at nuclear energy", prestigious experts John Parsons, Jacopo Buongiorno, Michael Corradini, and David Petti discuss the escalating need for green energy â€” and how nuclear energy could and should fill that role. (Parsons)


* Ernest Moniz, an American nuclear physicist and former United States Secretary of Energy, in an article titled "Why we still need nuclear power" from MIT Energy Initiative, states that nuclear energy is critical for power generation and combating climate change. (Moniz)
